 What is the best movie genre to invest in?
 
I recently discovered David Robinson's youtube channel for his TidyTuesday Screencast series (I have 3 years of experience with R and I learned so many new things. He is extremely fluent in R and I HIGHLY recommend watching his youtube channel) and one of the things I learned from his channel is that Horror movies have a reputation for being the best investment in Hollywood. This data analysis project is a result of my curiousity and I hope to share what I learned with others!

Contrary to David Robinson who does his TidyTuesday Screencasts in R, I decided this was a good opportunity to refamiliarize myself with Python and some of its packages (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, etc.). Some of the things I did in this project are:

- Joined and assembled disparate datasets from multiple sources 
- Create histograms, bar plots and line plots using packages matplotlib and seaborn
- Adjust production budgets for inflation and then classify those adjusted production budgets as low, mid, high
- Learned a lot about the movie industry and which distribution companies own the majority of the market share
- Learned how to make a pivot table and what the hell a pivot table is
- Learned how definitions of low, mid, or high budget films varies depending on who you're asking and the markets they work in (I explain some of this in my project because I believe it is just as important, if not MORE important, than the analysis I'm performing. It is during this time that I realize how important industry and domain knowledge is.)

Caveats:
- I limited my analysis to domestic success only since I don't feel confident about analyzing international gross just yet. I learned that although I can adjust production budgets and domestic gross for inflation, it's not a 1:1 thing with international gross. Movies that premiere or play in different countries have different markets, which have their own Consumer Pricing Index (CPI) different from the US's CPI. At the moment, I do not have access to that information, nor am I informed enough to proceed with that kind of analysis.
- This project is incomplete. Whenever I have free time and my schedule permits, I will continue to work on this project because I find the things I'm learning to be very compelling and I love learning more about movies and the movie industry in general. It is an industry I hope I'm lucky enough to have the opportunity to do some really cool things.
